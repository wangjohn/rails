  # FileUpdateChecker specifies the API used by Rails to watch files
  # and control reloading. The API depends on four methods:
  #
  # * +initialize+ which expects two parameters and one block as
  #   described below.
  #
  # * +updated?+ which returns a boolean if there were updates in
  #   the filesystem or not.
  #
  # * +execute+ which executes the given block on initialization
  #   and updates the latest watched files and timestamp.
  #
  # * +execute_if_updated+ which just executes the block if it was updated.
  #
  # After initialization, a call to +execute_if_updated+ must execute
  # the block only if there was really a change in the filesystem.
  #
  # This class is used by Rails to reload the I18n framework whenever
  # they are changed upon a new request.
  #
  #   i18n_reloader = ActiveSupport::FileUpdateChecker.new(paths) do
  #     I18n.reload!
  #   end
  #
  #   ActionDispatch::Reloader.to_prepare do
  #     i18n_reloader.execute_if_updated
  #   end
  #
  # One can use regex to filter or ignore particular files through the options
  # hash. For example, one could use:
  #
  #   opts = {:filter => /Gemfile/}
  #   listener = FileChangeListener.new(["/home/john/rails"], {}, opts)
  #   Thread.new do
  #     listener.start_listening
  #   end
  #
  # This would look at all of the files inside the "/home/john/rails" directory
  # and keep track of all the files that have been changed. To access the
  # changed files, one can read from the changed_files queue like so:
  #
  #   changed_file = listener.changed_files.pop()
  #
  # An alternative to creating a queue of changed files, one can elect to send
  # notifications to a particular notification group. The changed_files queue
  # will always stay empty, but the ChangedFile objects will be sent through
  # the ActiveSupport::Notifications framework. To do this, one needs to set
  # opts[:notifications] to the name of the notification group. For example:
  #
  #   opts = {:notifications => "filesystem_changes"}
  #   listener = FileChangeListener.new(["/home/john/rails"], {}, opts)
  #   Thread.new do
  #     listener.start_listening
  #   end
  #
  # In the above example, one would recieve the changed files in the
  # /home/john/rails directory if they subscribed to notifications as follows:
  #
  #   changed_files = []
  #   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("filesystem_changed") { |*args| changed_files << [*args] }
  #
  # Note that the start_listening method will continue infinitely, so it is
  # best called from within a new thread.
  class FileUpdateChecker
    attr_accessor :changed_files

    # It accepts two parameters on initialization. The first is an array
    # of files and the second is an optional hash of directories. The hash must
    # have directories as keys and the value is an array of extensions to be
    # watched under that directory.
    #
    # This method may also receive a block that will be called once a path
    # changes and execute or execute_if_updated is called. The array of files
    # and list of directories cannot be changed after FileUpdateChecker 
    # has been initialized.
    #
    # The options one can specify are the following:
    #
    #   :filter -> Only chooses paths matching the regex
    #
    #   :ignore -> Ignores all paths matching the regex
    #
    #   :cache_type -> Determines the type of file_cache used. Options are
    #   either :time or :checksum. If :time is chosen, then file changes are
    #   determined via the system time (note that changes which happen within
    #   a second of another change will not be noticed). If :checksum is
    #   chosen then an MD5 hash is computed over the file and the hash is
    #   checked for changes. Using :checksum will detect changes better than
    #   :time, but :time has significant performance advantages. The default
    #   :cache_type is :time.
    #
    #   :notifications -> Give the name of the group of the notifications
    #   which you would like to call upon file change. If this field is
    #   not nil, then the changed_files queue will always be empty and changed
    #   files will be sent via the appropriate notifications. The value of
    #   this field is notifications group name to which file change
    #   notifications are sent.
    #
    #   :recurse -> If true, then all of the subdirectories of the original
    #   paths will be searched recursively in a BFS fashion. All file changes
    #   will be detected, such as additions, deletions, and modifications.
